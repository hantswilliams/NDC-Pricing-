The drug database that contains pricing is: 
NADAC - National Pharmacy Pricing Database
Based on NADAC (National Average Drug Acquisition Cost

https://data.medicaid.gov/Drug-Pricing-and-Payment/National-Pharmacy-Pricing-Database-xls/uima-szn8

This link above provies NDC numbers, with corresponding NADAC_per_unit
Note - the per unit is per ingestion / pill for example 
So will need to also bring in other NDC data that relates to the package 
description for that drug 

This website here also has useful information, more HISTORICAL data:
