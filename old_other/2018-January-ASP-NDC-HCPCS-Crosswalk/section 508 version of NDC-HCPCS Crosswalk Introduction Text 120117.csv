"Effective January 1, 2005, Medicare will base payment for a Part B drug on 106% of the Average Sales Price (ASP) of the drug as reported quarterly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) by manufacturers.  Manufacturers submit ASP data at the 11-digit National Drug Code (NDC) level.  Providers mostly use Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes to bill Medicare for drugs and biologicals."

The ASP crosswalks are maintained by the Division of Ambulatory Services to support ASP-based Medicare Part B payments only. The crosswalks are intended to help the public (including entities that submit manufacturer ASP data and providers who bill for drugs) understand which drug products (identified by NDCs) are assigned to which HCPCS billing codes. The crosswalks are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all drugs/NDCs available in the United States. The NDC to HCPCS Crosswalk also includes information on the NDC package size and the number of billable units (as defined by the HCPCS code descriptor).  Comments on the file may be sent to sec303aspdata@cms.hhs.gov.
